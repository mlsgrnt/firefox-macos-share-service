# Open in Firefox share extension

## What?
The MacOS share menu is beautifully integrated into MacOS. Wouldn’t it be useful if all those buttons present in every good MacOS application had an option to open links in Firefox?

## How?
The code needs a lot of clean-up. In the future this could maybe support other browsers or even have a config app. Right now the default blank MacOS Xcode app is thrown up at the user when the app is launched.

## Where?
A fully working, but nevertheless proof-of-concept release [is available here](https://github.com/blydro/firefox-macos-share-service/releases/download/0.0.1/openInFirefox.app.zip)
